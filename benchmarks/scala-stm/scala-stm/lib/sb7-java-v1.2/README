STMBench7 Java
==============
	STMBench7 Java is built using Apache Ant building system. 
	The building process consists in compiling the STMBench7 java
	code and instrumenting the bytecode. 

	Note that STMBench7 successfully passes the Java-to-Java 
	precompilation phase of TMJava, however, this action is 
	idempotent as no __transaction{} blocks are used in STMBench7 
	but each transaction in the code is already an annotated method.

	For automatic instrumentation of transactional accesses
	STMBench7 uses the Deuce bytecode instrumentation framework, 
	which detects bytecode annotation to instrument memory accesses
	with a dedicated TM backend.	

PREREQUISITES
=============
	In order the build to work properly and resolve jar dependencies, 
	you have to download the Deuce agent. Deuce can be downloaded from:

	> http://www.velox-project.eu/software/deuce
	> http://sites.google.com/site/deucestm	

 	Set the the deuceAgent path in file build.xml under variable 
	named 'agent'.
	
	In addition, you must set the path towards your local Java RunTime 
	jar archive (e.g., /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk/jre/lib/rt.jar)

	STMBench7 Java has been successfully tested with 
	  * ant 1.7.1
	  * java 1.6.0_20
	  * deuceAgent 1.3.0
	
	Optionnally, TMJava variable 'precompiler' can be set to 
	the path of TMJava. TMJava can be downloaded from:

	> http://www.velox-project.eu/software/tmjava
	> http://tinystm.org/tmjava
	
ORGANIZATION
============
	build.xml	 the xml build file
	src/   		 the source directory
	COPYING		 licence
	README		 install information
	README.sb7	 STMBench7 overview

INSTALL
=======
	Set first the appropriate variable 'agent' and 'javart.home' 
	in build.xml
	
	> ant clean
	> ant 
	> ant instrument
	> ant instrument-rt

	You may test the benchmark with:
	
	> ant test	

	* which essentially runs java with the following arguments on 
	the command line:
	  -Dorg.deuce.exclude="java.lang.Enum,sun.*" 
	  (for classes that must not be instrumented)	  
	  -Dorg.deuce.transaction.contextClass=org.deuce.transaction.lsacm.Context 	    
	  (specifying to run the LSA library including a Contention Manager provided with Deuce)
	  -Xbootclasspath/p:rt_instrumented.jar:deuceAgent.jar, offline instrumentation 
	  (to support boot classloader) 
	  -cp jars/stmbench7-VELOX-v1.2_instrumented.jar indicating the jars
	  
	* and runs STMBench7 with options:
	  -l 1		     during 1 second
	  -t 16  	     running 16 threads 
	  -w rw 	     workload mixed of reads and writes
	  -g stm	     with the default Deuce STM algorithm
	  --no-traversals    disable traversal operations


OPTIONS
=======
	 -h help          -- print usage
         -t numThreads    -- set the number of threads (default: 1)
	 -l length        -- set the length of the benchmark, in seconds (default: 10)
         -w r|rw|w        -- set the workload: r = read-dominated, w = write-dominated
		          rw = read-write (default: read-dominated)
         -g coarse|medium|fine|none|stm -- set synchronization method (default: coarse)
	 -s stmInitializerClass         -- set STM initializer class (default: none)
         --no-traversals  -- do not use long traversals
         --no-sms         -- do not use structural modification operations
         --seq-replay     -- replay the execution in a single thread
	 		  (checks for opacity violations)
         --ttc-histograms -- print TTC histograms to stdout
         
	 NB. the benchmark needs a lot of lot of memory, so the -Xmx option of Java 
	 might be necessary.
